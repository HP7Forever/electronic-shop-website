We are the members of Group 15 and we have developed two projects first is web based and the second is an android app to explore more and more features of Firebase.
Firstly I will be describing about the web application which is named as “ElecShop” which is an E-commerce website  which mainly deals in selling Laptops,Desktops and other accessories related to that such as CPU cabinet, keyboard, mouse charger etc. 
So in our website we have used firebase authentication for Sign in so that user cannot sign in two different user with the same Email Id, Next we have used the firebase realtime databse which will store the Customers billing address and Transaction details when customer buys something from the site , then we have used the firebase hosting to host our website . 
Now talking about our website so when any user visits our website the user first will see the login and sing up button which allow user to get logged in to our website which will help to user to receive latest  upcoming offers of our website  , then there is a navbar which will allow the user to t navigate to the different sections of our website like Contact Us page , Products Page etc.
When user goes to the products page the user will see the different offers which are currently on on the website and also some upcoming feature the on products page there is a navbar which contains Laptops, desktops  and other accessories which acts like a button when a user click on that particular button the user will redirect to that particular section on that page like if user clicks on Laptops the the user will be redirect to the laptop  section which contains the slider where variety of laptops and shown so that the user can buy a laptop from the large range of laptops  and when any user clicks on the buy now button the user will be redirect to the transaction page which will asks user to enter the delivery address and will also ask the card details to place the order .In transaction page we have used javascript validation which will notify the user to enter data in all the fields .Until and unless the user enters all the required data ,Order will not be placed and user will not be directed to the thank You page .
Once the user reach to the Thank you page the User then can  go back again to the products page to buy other products.  Then comes  the contact us Page where  we have used the firebase realtime databse to store  the users message or any query related to our site .
